# Data Analyst, SteamaCo, Manchester, July 2018 – October 2020

*Cuantitative analysis of  GSM/SMS/MMS communications,  financial data an plain text*

Hired as the first Data Analyst of [SteamaCo](https://steama.co/), the world's most data-efficient smart meter manufacturer, my first project consisted on developing, using python, a system to evaluate the telecommunication costs of the company. The system was built from scratch: data acquisition and cleaning from our providers (REST APIs, CSV, XML, HTML, scraping), matching with the internal API information, report and KPIs generation. As well, providing visibility of this data was part of my job.  After that project, the role evolved to the generation of new ways to use the power of data:  via reports, charts, dashboard integrations of the mySQL company’s database (Grafana, kibana and lately Power BI) to help commercial and sales make data driven decisions. We have exploited the advantages of data for customer support, too. Mainly by the automation of checks and cronjobs on a ‘Data Analysis server’ and generation of visibility on the internal metrics of the product. On the operational side, I have played a role by helping to make data driven decisions to some development and product-improvement projects. Another project was the development of a mySQL database and integrations to store financial and billing information for financial team. As a result of working with all parts of the company, I have been exposed and used different coding languages (python, javascript, R, matlab), data sources (HTML, JSON, mySQL, XML), cloud-based computing products (EC2 instance, RDS and DynamoDB databases from AWS), OS (Unix and Windows), visualization libraries (seaborn, pyplot, ggplot2) or machine learning algorithms: Clustering (hierarchical, k-means), PCA and regression models.

- Data integration from CSV files, SQL Databases, etc with web platforms (Xero)
- Creation of reports and documentation in different formats, such as, HTML (D3, Confluence) or Office (Powerpoint, Excel)
- KPI and business metrics developement (Spatial Averages, ROI indexes, per activity unit cost, etc)

## Projects

### Evaluation and Account Automation of Telecommunications Cost / Automatización de la evaluación y alocación de costes de Telecomunicación 

#### Business Case 
The company struggled to view where the telecoms costs that their product was incurring on. Main causes were a variety of different SIM providers with different billing systems and technologies to provide data. As well, different currencies and pay cycles.

#### Actions taken : 
 1. Documentation on tabular/text of the different providers and their billing logics
 2. Creation of a system that retrieve the billing information via http requests and web  scrapping.
 3. Creation of a script to encapsulate the billing logic and account for the costs incurred in a single currency and a internal billing cycle.
 4. Creation of a program/script to transform  the billing data and its visualisation for a non technical audience - Financial Team-.
 5.  Integration of part of the costs with Financial Software Tools (posterior improvement of the otriginal system).
 6. Monthly analysis on trends, changes and evaluation of the changes implemented with new policies, new providers etc. Consisting on a meeting and presentation with relevant partners. 
 7. Continuous documentation both of the software evolution and the business changes.

#### Software Used:
- Python (Selenium, pandas, requests, httplib, json, mysql)
- MySQL
- Excel, Powerpoint and JavaScript (D3)
- Xero
- Open Access Data Sources (xe.com, tim)
- Confluence -for documentation-
