# Digital Data Analyst, CHEP UK&I Ltd, Manchester UK, January 2021 - October 2022

The role was within the process of  Digitization of [Brambles Group](https://www.brambles.com/). More specifically, as a bridge between CHEP and [BxB Digital](https://www.chep.com/us/en/bxb-digital). My main tasks consisted on making possible the communication of Complex Data and Phenomena happening accross the location-tracked network of Pallets that CHEP had deployed with BxB Digital technical support. As well, I did support BxB Digital providing feedback on different Dashboards and digital products to be used by CHEP and external staff.

As part of that support and consultancy work, I produced reports and PowerBI Dashboards defining new metrics  and KPIs to inform the physical flow of pallets and their relative position within the UK's supply chain. In order to produce those reports different. Transformations needed to be applied to the semi processed data that BxB Digital tools were able to produce. 

Another key aspect within the role my duties presenting these reports and the insights around them to different stakeholders that could find them of use, such  as Sales & Customers Relations Teams, Leakage Team, Financial Teams, or External Customers i.e. [Saica](https://www.saica.com/en/). 

As a result of these efforts [and my team's] new projects across the group were set up in order to produce an MVP and new services that Tracked Pallets can offer.
