# Research Assistant. HIDRUS research group (University of Salamanca), Salamanca, Spain, June - September 2016

I helped in the validation and analyses of soil moisture measurements made by SMOS mission. SMOS mission is an ESA (European Space Agency) active project which is trying to prove that Soil Moisture can be measured from space in extended areas (continental scale).  My duties consisted on acquisition (SQL database), cleansing and interpreting soil moisture time series given by SMOS satellite. All the software was developed in Python language. Matplotlib library was used for data visualization. To perform cleansing and analysing duties pandas and numpy libraries were employed

## Functions

- GeoSpatial data acquistion and aggregation, using pandas and ArcGis
