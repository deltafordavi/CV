*Electricity consumption model developing and analysis*

As a part of a two members team and guided by a PhD researcher, I developed software to analyse electricity consumption from houses. We used data from a German electric company. Our duty consisted on classifying different parts of daily signals, in order to determine different patterns in them. Those patterns could be related to different sources like fridges, heating bombs, microwaves and any other electric devices or household appliances. We achieved some of our goals with a successful software which could classify some of the patterns and relate them with specific devices. Matlab was our main tool. We used it for visualization and pattern recognition. The classification process was performed using sci-kit learning library on Python.
